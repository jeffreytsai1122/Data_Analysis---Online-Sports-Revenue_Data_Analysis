# Project Overview
Sports clothing and athleisure attire is a huge industry, worth approximately $193 billion in 2021 with a strong growth forecast over the next decade! This project provides data-driven insights into how strategic pricing and effective communication contribute to online retail success in the competitive sportswear market.

# Methodology
The analysis used Python (pandas and matplotlib) for data filtering, grouping, aggregation, and computation.

# Key Findings
- Adidas has a stronger pricing structure and better premium positioning.
- Moderate, informative product descriptions tend to enhance customer satisfaction.

# Takeaway
I gained hands-on experience in data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Python (pandas)—developing not only technical proficiency but also stronger analytical thinking. By structuring and interpreting real-world e-commerce data, I learned how to derive actionable insights from complex datasets and communicate them effectively through concise summaries.
